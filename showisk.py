'''
Showisk (asterisk enabled interactive show) enables someone to use asterisk (open-source PBX) 
to place multiple calls to people (aka actors) and playback synchronized audio files, while 
allowing for choices to be made by the actors. One can create complicated audio plans with arbitrary
many sync points, and decision trees of arbitrary depth.
It relies on pyst and specififally the Python interface to the Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI)

	'''
	The audio plan is structured as follows: It is a list of periods. A period is the sync checkpoint
	for all actors. All actors should complete their path of actions before starting the next period.
	A period is a list of trees, one for each actor (technically is a dict/map of trees)
	A tree is a tree of actions and possible options that an Actor has at a given period. An action
	is an audio file to be played. A tree is represented as a dictionary (of possibly nested
	dictionaries). Generally in Python, a dictionary, has  multiple entries of the form key:value
	separated with commas. In our tree representation, if a key has non-numeric value then it is
	interpreted as an audio filename to be played. The value of the key is the next action to take.
	'None' means that nothing happens and we are done. The value can also be another tree! If the key
	values are numeric, then the program interprets this as a choice that needs to be made by the user
	by pressing a number in the phone keypad (DTMF tones). Once the choice is made and is valid, then
	the value of the corresponding key is the action. It can be a simple filename (in which case the
	corresponding filename is played and we are done) or it can be another tree. This way we can
	build arbitrarily complex trees of actions and options. When creating options it is a good idea for
	the preceding audio file to explain these options and ask you to take them. For example if we have
	this tree {'blah':{1:'hi', 2:'bye'}} it will play the 'blah' and then just wait for a DTMF tone.
	So the valid options should be given and explained at the end of audio file 'blah'
	If the DTMF tone pressed is not one of the options given, it will 'say please try again'
	The program will try to get a correct input for x secs (x=30 by default). Giving an invalid
	input will not reset this timer. If no valid option is given, a default option will be taken by
	the program. Currenly th default option is 1, but you one can easily change this when calling
	the function waitForDTMF
